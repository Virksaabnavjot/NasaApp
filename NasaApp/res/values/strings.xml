   important asset - our people, and our way of working. We use retrospectives, workshops, 
 clubs, feedback, reflection, educations, and many other tools to do this.

Qualifications:

You have more than three years experience working as an Agile Coach, Scrum Master,

what we’re doing. We hope it’s infectious! At such a fast moving company you’ll find 
opportunities rather than boundaries in every single role.

\n \n
Who are we looking for?
\n
Experience from working with analysis at a consumer-oriented company in the digital space.
A degree in mathematics, statistics or computer science is meriting.
The key skill we are looking for is intellectual curiosity and the ability to understand and 
solve not always well-defined problems and come up with relevant answers to guide our business
 decisions.However this needs to be combined with a passion for numbers, statistics as well 
 as strong business and financial acumen.
To be able to work with our very large datasets and automate processes, programming skills
 is a must.
Experience with modelling in Excel.
 \n
 
Most of the Spotify backend is written in Python, but previous experience with Python is 
not required. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you want to grow and learning new programming 
languages is something you do with ease anyway. You should preferably have worked with large data
 sets before, the larger, the better. Experience with various databases, MapReduce and similar
  is definitely something we value.
 \n
You’ll be working with a world-class team of analysts and engineers who are passionate about
 what they do - and we expect no less from you. You should have an insatiable appetite for
  learning new things and improving existing ones. If you’re the right one for us, you pay 
 to details and take great pride in your work.
